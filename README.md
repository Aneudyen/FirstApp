App Idea: "BodegaGo"
Description: BodegaGo is an intuitive mobile app designed specifically for local bodegas and neighborhood customers. 
The app enables bodegas to digitally list their products, manage real-time inventory, and accept seamless in-app payments. 
Customers can conveniently browse available items, add them to a cart, and choose either local pickup or delivery. 
Features include automatic inventory tracking, geolocation-based delivery zones, secure payment processing, and order status notifications. 
This modernizes bodegas by expanding their reach, improving customer convenience, and enhancing operational efficiency through streamlined inventory management.


## Notes

Try to connect the button to the view controller, so I can change the background color.
